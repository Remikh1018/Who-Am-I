        <h3>Summmary about the USA</h3>
        Currently I live in Canada, but used to live in the United States. When I was 9 me, and my family moved from Edmonton To Louisiana. We spent a few years there before moving back to Edmonton.

      <h3>What it was like</h3>
      The first year was hard getting to know new people, and adjusting to a new life style. Once I got used to it, and made friends it was very fun. Also I loved the weather there since it was alwasy hot so pretty much the opposite of Edmonton.
